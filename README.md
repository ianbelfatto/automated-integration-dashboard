# Automated Integration Dashboard

![Dashboard Screenshot Placeholder](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Dashboard+Screenshot)
*(Consider replacing this placeholder with a screenshot of your live dashboard!)*

## Project Description

This project features a full-stack web application designed as a content management dashboard. It demonstrates the seamless integration between a modern frontend framework (Vue.js) and a robust Python backend (Flask), showcasing data persistence through a self-managed database and interaction with external APIs. The dashboard allows users to view, create, and manage content, providing a practical example of a deployed, interactive web application.

## Key Features

* **View Recent Posts:** Displays posts fetched from a custom SQLite database managed by the Flask backend, persisted across sessions.
* **Create New Posts:** Allows users to publish new posts which are saved to the backend's database.
* **Data Persistence:** New posts remain in the database even after the application or browser is refreshed.
* **View Recent Comments:** Integrates with an external third-party API (JSONPlaceholder) to display recent comments, demonstrating API integration.
* **Responsive UI:** (Add if you've made it mobile-friendly, otherwise remove or adapt)
* **Full-Stack Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns between frontend presentation and backend logic.

## Live Demo

Experience the dashboard live in your browser:

* **Frontend (Dashboard):** [https://automated-integration-dashboard.vercel.app/](https://automated-integration-dashboard.vercel.app/)
* **Backend (API Base URL):** [https://my-dashboard-backend-3qdq.onrender.com/](https://my-dashboard-backend-3qdq.onrender.com/) *(Visiting this link will show "Backend with database is running!")*

## Tech Stack

This project leverages the following technologies:

### Frontend

* **Vue.js 3:** Progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
* **JavaScript:** Core programming language.
* **HTML5:** Structure of the web pages.
* **CSS3:** Styling of the user interface.
* **Vue CLI:** Standard tooling for Vue.js development.
* **Axios / Fetch API:** For making HTTP requests to the backend.

### Backend

* **Python 3:** Core programming language.
* **Flask:** Lightweight web framework for building APIs.
* **Flask-SQLAlchemy:** Flask extension for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) with SQLAlchemy, simplifying database interactions.
* **Flask-CORS:** Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing for secure communication between frontend and backend.
* **Gunicorn:** Python WSGI HTTP Server for production deployment.
   * **Requests:** HTTP library for making external API calls (used for comments).

### Database

* **SQLite:** Lightweight, file-based relational database, used for data persistence of posts.

### Deployment

* **Vercel:** Platform for deploying the frontend (static assets) with continuous deployment.
* **Render.com:** Cloud platform for deploying the backend service with continuous deployment.
* **Git & GitHub:** Version control and code hosting.

## Installation & Local Setup

To run this project on your local machine for development:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YourGitHubUsername]/automated-integration-dashboard.git
cd automated-integration-dashboard
2. Backend Setup (Flask/Python)
Navigate into the backend directory, create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and set up the database.

Bash

cd backend

# Create a Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows (Command Prompt):
# venv\Scripts\activate
# On Windows (PowerShell):
# .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# On macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh):
# source venv/bin/activate

# Install backend dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Flask backend server
# This will also create the SQLite database (posts.db) and seed initial data if it doesn't exist
python app.py
# Or for production-like local testing:
# gunicorn app:app -b 127.0.0.1:5000
The backend server will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

3. Frontend Setup (Vue.js)
Open a new terminal tab/window, navigate into the frontend directory, and install dependencies.

Bash

cd ../frontend # If you are still in the backend directory
# Or from the project root: cd frontend

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Run the Vue.js development server
npm run serve
The frontend application will typically run on http://localhost:8080 (or another port if 8080 is in use).

4. Open in Browser
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to interact with the dashboard.

Future Enhancements (Ideas for Continued Development)
User Authentication & Authorization: Implement user login, registration, and protect API routes with tokens (e.g., JWT).

CRUD for Comments: Extend the backend to manage comments in its own database, not just rely on JSONPlaceholder.

More Complex Data Models: Add relationships (e.g., users having many posts, posts having many tags).

Advanced UI/UX: Implement pagination, searching, filtering, or richer text editors for posts.

Environment Variables: Refactor hardcoded URLs in the frontend to use environment variables for better deployment flexibility.

Production Database: Migrate from SQLite to a more robust database like PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Automated Testing: Add unit tests for backend API endpoints and frontend components.
